# bootstrap.yml for config-server (Usually empty or minimal as it IS the config source)
# Config server does not fetch its own config from itself in most cases.
# Its primary configuration is in application.yml.

# spring:
#   application:
#     name: config-server # Self-reference if needed for some advanced scenarios
#   cloud:
#     config:
#       uri: http://localhost:8888 # Points to itself (not typical)
