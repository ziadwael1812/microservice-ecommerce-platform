# Eureka client configuration should be fetched from Config Server as part of api-gateway.yml
# However, if you need to specify Eureka settings *before* config server is contacted (e.g., for discovery-first bootstrap),
# you might put minimal Eureka client settings here. But typically, it's better to manage it via Config Server.
